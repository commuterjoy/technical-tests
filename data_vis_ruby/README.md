RUBY / FRONT END DEVELOPER ASSESSMENT
------------------------------------

This example is designed to demonstrate your ruby and front end development skills. You should be prepared to spend at least two hours on it, we suggest that 50% of your effort is on the ruby side and 50% on the front end.

The file data.csv includes the monthly number of broadcasts per BBC channel for the year 2009 (maybe not 100% accurate!). We would like you to develop a small ruby application to nicely display the data in a HTML front end.

Please also add some element of user input into the application, such as the ability to filter by channel or date range (feel free to add some fictional test data to the CSV if needed). This will allow you to demonstrate how you handle HTTP post requests and the cleansing of incoming user data.

The test has been deliberately left broad to allow you to choose the best methods to complete the exercise. Architect the application using your experience in Ruby and use your UX skills to decide how best to represent the data.

We realise that you may not have time to do all of the below but here are a few things we expect from our developers:

* Produce high quality and maintainable ruby code
* To use MVC type frameworks (we prefer Sinatra but use what you know!)
* To sensibly separate functionality following OO paradigms
* Use of appropriate design patterns
* Accessible and semantic HTML
* Valid HTML
* Unobtrusive javascript
* Clean visual design
* Test cases for your code
* Well commented code
* Follow coding standards
* Use of caching (HTTP, Memcache, etc)

Hopefully this will not be too much of a boring exercise and we encourage you to do something different to set yourself apart from the other candidates. If your stuck for inspiration or feel like showing off here is a list of some interesting and relevant things our team has played about with recently:

* Creating charts and graphs with javascript (using Raphael JS)
* Dynamically generating images with ruby GD
* Using content negotiation to serialise API data into multiple formats (XML, JSON, CSV, YAML)
* Creating reusable UX widgets, e.g. sortable tables
* Running integration tests on javascript applications
* Creating statistics modules, e.g. mean, median, standard deviation
