Please see the attached document. This document outlines the visual and interaction design pattern that should be in use wherever pagination is required. Read the document carefully, and then complete the following brief below;

Your task is to construct a page that can cycle through the breaking news ticker feeds when a user interacts with your pagination device. Please note the following product requirements;

1) The page MUST contain a  description field, which shows each exactly ONE item from the feed at a time as the user cycles through them
2) The page MUST contain your pagination device which SHOULD contain no more than 7 buttons. The user can navigate through the news feed in either direction.
3) For reasons of modular re-use, your pagination device MUST accept its feed in the JSON format.  You are very welcome to work with the example provided.

We place no stipulation on how you implement this product (save those mentioned in the requirements above). For example, you could choose to show your understanding in, but not limited too, any of the following means;

1) How you load the data (static file, middleware language of choice)
2) Demonstrate your knowledge of semantic markup
3) Provide unit tests or other methodology to demonstrate your code resilience.

We would like a working product that meets the requirements described above. Given individuals time constraints, we do not expect a fully functioning, releasable product, and quality will be just as important as quantity. The work you provide will form the basis of part of your interview discussion, so be prepared to be able to talk about and express your reasons for implementation decisions!
