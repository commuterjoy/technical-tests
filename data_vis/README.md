PHP / FRONT END DEVELOPER ASSESSMENT
------------------------------------

This example is designed to demonstrate your PHP and front end development skills. You should be prepared to spend at least two hours on it, we suggest that 50% of your effort is on the PHP side and 50% on the front end.

The file data.csv includes the monthly number of broadcasts per BBC channel for the year 2009 (maybe not 100% accurate!). We would like you to develop a small PHP application to nicely display the data in a HTML front end.

Please also add some element of user input into the application, such as the ability to filter by channel or date range (feel free to add some fictional test data to the CSV if needed). This will allow you to demonstrate how you handle HTTP post requests and the cleansing of incoming user data.

The test has been deliberately left broad to allow you to choose the best methods to complete the exercise. Architect the application using your experience in PHP and use your UX skills to decide how best to represent the data.

Please use a PHP framework you feel comfortable with but try not to rely on any uncommon PEAR or PECL extensions. If you've not used CSV files in PHP before you might find the following function useful ...

We realise that you may not have time to do all of the below but here are a few things we expect from our developers:

* Produce high quality and maintainable PHP code
* To use MVC frameworks (we prefer Zend but use what you know!)
* To sensibly separate functionality following OO paradigms
* Use of appropriate design patterns
* Accessible and semantic HTML
* Valid HTML
* Unobtrusive javascript
* Clean visual design
* Test cases for your code
* Well commented code
* Follow coding standards
* Use of caching (HTTP, APC, Memcache, etc)

Hopefully this will not be too much of a boring exercise and we encourage you to do something different to set yourself apart from the other candidates. If your stuck for inspiration or feel like showing off here is a list of some interesting and relevant things our team has played about with recently:

* Creating charts and graphs with javascript (using Raphael JS)
* Dynamically generating images with PHP GD
* Using content negotiation to serialise API data into multiple formats (XML, JSON, CSV, YAML)
* Creating reusable UX widgets, e.g. sortable tables
* Running integration tests on javascript applications
* Creating PHP statistics modules, e.g. mean, median, standard deviation
