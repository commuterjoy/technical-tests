BBC Test Engineer Role: Practical Assessment
--------------------------------------------

This short task should give you the opportunity to demonstrate your skills and experience as a test engineer. It should take a round 2 hours, once you have finished please package all the files in a .tar or .zip archive and send them back to us at the BBC.

BBC Food Recipes Page QA
------------------------

The new BBC Food site was released recently and the recipes homepage is one of the most important entry points for visitors.

 http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/

We would like you to write some automated tests for the page based on some of our original requirements in the file called REQUIREMENTS. 

Some things we would like you to keep in mind are ...

* The requirements have not been written from a tester's / programmers perspective. You should make them more specific / structured. You should add any important technical aspects you think are missing. Can you get the requirements in a state where they would be suitable for driving your test suite?

We know that in usual circumstances you'd iron out these requirements with the product owner and developers but please use your own discretion for this exercise!

* We *really* like Cucumber and Selenium tests here, although we are pragmatic and open to suggestions about different tools, especially if they integrate well with our two current favourites. Whatever you decide to use please ensure it is widely available, well known and open source. Concordion is fine if you want to use that.

* We like files! Please provide all of the files you have created to run your tests. Where relevant please point us to some useful docs (e.g if you provide non Selenium / Cucumber files).

* We like notes and docs. Ideally any technical person should be able to run the test suite you provide so please let us know what we need to do so.

* We like configurability. Maybe we want to run the tests against different environments or we might want to use a different Selenium server this should be easily configurable.

* You don't have access to the database, so if you need test fixture data just write pseudocode for any database queries.

Please let us know if you have any questions about this, we'll be happy to help you make the correct decisions!

Good luck :)
