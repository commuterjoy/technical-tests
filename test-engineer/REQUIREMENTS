REQUIREMENTS FOR BBC FOOD RECIPES PAGE
--------------------------------------

http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/

Search bar
----------

We would like a search bar at the top of the page to help user's find recipes. The design team has produced a design that implements a Google suggest style drop-down and would really like that to get implemented.

We'd also like to display some recent popular terms and some of the top recipes recommended by our users.

All time favourites
-------------------

We'd like a section that links to the top 16 all time favourites. There should be an image with each link and we'd like it displayed in an alphabetical order.

Cooking with ...
----------------

To have a section where we can link through to recipes using certain ingredients, there should be 12 different foods to cook with and an image of each one.
